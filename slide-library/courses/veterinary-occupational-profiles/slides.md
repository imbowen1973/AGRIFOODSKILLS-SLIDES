## Specialist Veterinary Clinical Educator

<div class="twocol">

<div class="col">

### Role Definition

A veterinary clinician-educator is a practising veterinarian who combines clinical practice with the supervision and education of postgraduate trainees, including new graduates, residents, and interns.

They operate within accredited training programmes, residency schemes, and structured graduate development pathways, ensuring alignment with professional regulatory standards and institutional frameworks.

### Core Functions

- Oversight of patient care while mentoring learners towards independent clinical mastery
- Delivery of structured teaching sessions
- Conduct of workplace-based assessments and formal appraisals
- Development of inclusive clinical learning environments



</div>

<div class="col">

### Professional Orientation

The role balances functions as coach, mentor, and supervisor while maintaining responsibility for patient care.

Feedback is delivered using principles of radical candour: caring personally while challenging directly.

The role supports learner wellbeing and autonomy and promotes diversity, equity, and mattering within clinical teams.

### Governance and Quality

- Alignment of educational activities with institutional and regulatory frameworks
- Participation in quality improvement and educational scholarship
- Responsibility for ensuring assessments are fair, reliable, and aligned with learning outcomes

<div class="col">

### ESCO and Classification Context

- ESCO classification: Partially exists within "Specialised veterinarian"
- Gap identified: Explicit pedagogical and supervisory competencies not captured

### Skills Need and Evidence Base

- Skills need: Existing and widespread
- Evidence:
  - 45% graduate attrition within first two years (FVE, 2024)
  - Mentoring programmes associated with 30% reduction in attrition
  - Emerging structured clinical education frameworks

</div>

<div class="col">

### Strategic Assessment

- Strategic importance: 5 / 5
- Scale of impact: 5 / 5
- Urgency: 5 / 5
- Overall assessment: 5.0 / 5

- Skills need: Emerging (2–3 year horizon)
- Evidence:
  - EU workforce surveys indicate 60% of clinical research lacks formal methodology training
  - Increasing requirement for practice-based evidence in regulatory submissions
- Contested issue:
  - Whether this constitutes a distinct occupation or an enhanced competency set

## AI VALIDATION

<div class="twocol">

<div class="col">

### ESCO fit & classification

Overlaps substantially with *Official veterinarian* and your proposed *One Health specialist*; EU initiatives (BETTER/BioSecure COST & Horizon) already framing standardised biosecurity capability across sectors

### Global demand

Persistent transboundary risk; implementation gaps on farms (strong).

### Tech drivers

Risk tools, dashboards, ML risk scoring

### Societal/regulatory

Animal Health Law emphasises prevention; multiple biosecurity programmes funded (strong).

</div>

<div class="col">

### Strategic Assessment

- Strategic Importance: 5/5 (Strong - directly supports evidence-based medicine)
- Scale of Impact: 4/5 (Moderate - affects clinical standards across sector)
- Urgency: 4/5 (High - current gap in translational research)

**Overall: 4/5**
